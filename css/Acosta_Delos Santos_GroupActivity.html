        <h1 style="color:mediumseagreen;">Romantic But Tragic</h1>
        <p>I used to be good with words, but suddenly,<br>the moment your eyes met mine,<br>I lost them, instead,<br>my heart started beating mercilessly.
        It wants to speak with you.</p>

        <p>I wish you knew, the thoughts I have about you<br>I wish I could explain the feeling when I saw you.<br>I wish you knew, I look for you in the crowds.<br>
        I wish you knew that I change my directions just to see you.</p>

        <p>I love it when you smile,<br>And as if I am the reason for that,<br>It makes it all a lot better<br>
        The most beautiful part is, I wasn't even looking when I found you.</p>

        <p>I have longing, he is killing me.<br>He dances in my thoughts, and I connot stop it<br>He laugh so perfectly and it keeps me alive, yet I die evryday<br>
        For he's already dancing with someone, and it's not me.</p>

        <p>I was afraid of losing chances,<br>And not being with the person I thought was for me<br>While waiting when will the clock struck better<br>
        I could watch you fall and be drowned in love, but not for me.</p>

        <p>He was almost inlove.<br>I was almost good for him.<br>He almost stopped me, I almost waited<br>He almost lived, they almost made it.</p>
